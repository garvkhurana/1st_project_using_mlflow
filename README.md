California House Price Prediction with MLflow

Overview

This repository focuses on building a California Housing Price Prediction Model using Scikit-Learn's inbuilt dataset. The primary objective is to demonstrate MLflow's capabilities in tracking, logging, and managing machine learning experiments.

MLflow Integration

MLflow is used for experiment tracking, model logging, and performance visualization. It enables reproducibility by recording hyperparameters, metrics, and trained models. The project follows a structured approach to integrating MLflow, ensuring seamless tracking of different runs and comparisons.

Key Features

Training a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.

Logging model parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow.

Utilizing MLflow UI for visual analysis and comparison.

Storing and loading trained models efficiently.

Future Improvements

Implementing hyperparameter tuning with MLflow.

Deploying the trained model using MLflow's model registry.

Extending the project with cloud-based MLflow tracking for scalability.
